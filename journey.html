            Coding is one idea that causes me to lose sight of time. Yes,
            programming; because I view coding as an art and I truly appreciate
            art, when I write code I often feel like a sort of artist. Writing
            code is a creative process that allows me to use my creativity and
            logic to address specific problems by coming up with new solutions
            from start. I feel like a genius when I see my code come to life,
            and it is incredibly satisfying and offers a sense of deep
            contentment. Particularly when the code I develop performs as
            expected. The process of coming up with ideas on whiteboards, making
            flowcharts, and then writing code on my computer appears to be quite
            quick, but in reality, it takes a lot of time merely to think about
            the issue at hand to be solved and the best way to approach it. Even
            if it takes a while to integrate all potential outcomes into a
            workable solution, the effort is ultimately worthwhile because the
            code turns out to be flawless. Coding helps me achieve a state of
            total immersion in the subject at hand, sharpening my focus and
            enabling me to think more deeply until the activity's objective is
            met. When I am in a focused condition and working on my code, time
            appears to fly by. I can never keep track of how much time I spend
            on process ideation or even debugging. Total focus combined with
            focus jams simply keep me in a condition where I may not even be
            aware of my surroundings. It seems like everything is just so
            perfect to keep me in that mentality for so many hours while working
            code, and it helps me solve problems more quickly and effectively.
            This is especially true when I'm in the appropriate frame of mind,
            listening to some calming music, and using the right editor theme.
            Knowing how much effort was put into creating it and how much time
            was spent writing code, thinking, and debugging to see my
            once-imagined app come to life almost makes me feel really emotional
            and gives me a sense of ownership. Building tangible websites, apps,
            or software is a great sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. Many
            people may not be aware of the time spent developing that particular
            piece of software, but as a software developer, I am aware of the
            frustrations brought on by bugs that want to make you rip your hair
            out or even smash your computer. One thing that keeps me interested
            in coding is continuous learning. The world is continuously
            changing, and I always try to keep learning new approaches to solve
            specific problems, new frameworks, and even new programming
            languages, because I need to keep up with the technologies that have
            advanced. I love to adapt to changes. The experience is kept
            interesting and new through this approach. I find myself engrossed
            and even motivated to learn more about a certain idea when I go
            further into how frameworks operate or how a specific problem might
            be solved utilizing a simpler and more effective way. My mentor
            constantly helps me grasp the particular topic I'm interested in and
            how they apply it in practical situations, which gives me a clearer
            knowledge of how the subject operates. In the absence of my mentor,
            I turn to my online community where people frequently share their
            concerns and suggestions for solutions. I always get answers to my
            questions and sometimes I even get to contribute, which helps me
            learn more about that idea. In conclusion, learning to code is not
            simply a vocation or a talent but also an artistic endeavor that
            involves constant exploration and problem-solving. The feeling of
            community and common excitement enhance this journey even more,
            whether it is backed by a thriving online community or mentors.
